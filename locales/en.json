  "questionDescriptionHidden2": "A sworn translator is a person of public trust. Our translators can conduct translations of procedural and official documents for you, authenticate foreign-language copies of such documents, and certify translations and copies made by other individuals",
  "questiontitle3": "When is a sworn translation needed?",
  "questionDescription3": "A sworn translation, also known as certified translation, is a type of document translation that holds legal validity.",
  "questionDescriptionHidden3": "A sworn translation, also known as certified translation, is a type of document translation that holds legal validity. These document translations can only be performed by sworn translators who have received special authorization from the Ministry of Justice. The translated documents must meet all official requirements, making them recognized by government authorities and various institutions",
  "questiontitle4": "How long does it take to receive the translation?",
  "questionDescription4": "Firstly, the time required for translation largely depends on the type of text, including its complexity and field.",
  "questionDescriptionHidden4": "Firstly, the time required for translation largely depends on the type of text, including its complexity and field. Translations can cover both light and accessible topics as well as complex subjects that require specialized knowledge. Another factor directly influencing the deadline for a commissioned translation is its length. It is evident that a shorter translation can be completed much faster than a similarly themed one, but with several more pages. The qualifications of the translator, their experience, and familiarity with the subject matter of the assigned translation also play a significant role. Considering these aspects, the translation turnaround time can range from a few hours (for less advanced texts) to several days (for complex texts)",
  "questiontitle5": "What factors affect the cost of translation?",
  "questionDescription5": "he cost of translation is primarily dependent on factors such as the translation direction, which means the language pair for the translation.",
  "questionDescriptionHidden5": "The cost of translation is primarily dependent on factors such as the translation direction, which means the language pair for the translation. It is commonly known that the cost of translating into Polish will be lower than the price required for translation into a foreign language. The original language and the target language also influence the rate. English, French, Russian, and German are languages known for having a competitive pricing. The type of translation also plays a significant role. Distinguishing between specialized and general text is crucial, as specialized texts require more advanced knowledge, making them more expensive. The basic price of translation also varies depending on the translator's work mode - if the translator is forced to work on a specific task urgently, they may expect higher compensation. The same applies to work done 'after hours,' during public holidays, or at night. Additionally, a higher price for translation should be anticipated when the provided text for translation contains errors or is difficult to read",
  "questiontitle6": "What stages does the process of handling a translation project involve?",
  "questionDescription6": "First, the text is analyzed, determining the costs of translation work and the time needed for completion.",
  "questionDescriptionHidden6": "First, the text is analyzed, determining the costs of translation work and the time needed for completion. Then, a translator or a team of translators is selected to handle the given text. The executor or executors first familiarize themselves with the document, also to deepen their knowledge in the specific field if necessary. They then proceed to work, using appropriate terminological dictionaries, glossaries, or similar projects completed in the past. A draft translation is created, which undergoes necessary editing and changes, after which the text is thoroughly verified - first by the team (syntax, punctuation, spelling, content level), and later by a specialist or specialists in the relevant field who verify the applied scientific terminology. Finally, a final check is conducted, involving aspects such as the document's layout, format compliance, and adherence to the client's specific guidelines, after which the translated text is delivered to the client "
